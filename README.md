# 🔐 Simple Form Validation (Email & Password)

This is a basic web form project built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It includes two fields — one for email and one for password — with client-side validation rules applied.

## ✨ Features

- Clean and minimal design
- Validates email input:
  - At least 3 characters
  - Must include `@` and `.`
- Validates password input:
  - At least 8 characters
- Displays validation error messages
- Shows success message using `alert()` when all validations pass

└── script.js       # JavaScript form validation logic
```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Make sure all three files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) are in the same folder.
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## 🧠 Validation Logic

- **Email Validation**
  - Must be at least 3 characters long
  - Must contain both `@` and `.`
- **Password Validation**
  - Must be at least 8 characters long

If all validations pass, an alert will pop up saying:  
`Login Successful!`
